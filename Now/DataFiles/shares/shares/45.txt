Therefore, in the Phase 3 study CEL-SCI treated patients who are newly diagnosed with advanced primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, are treated with the investigational product Multikine first, BEFORE they received surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy (the current standard of care for these patients). This approach is unique. Most other cancer immunotherapies are administered only after conventional therapies have been tried and/or failed. Multikine (Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection), has received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for the neoadjuvant therapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (cancer) of the head and neck.\r \r CEL-SCI believes that this Phase 3 study is the largest Phase 3 study in the world for the treatment of head and neck cancer. Per the study’s protocol, newly diagnosed patients with advanced primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were treated with the Multikine treatment regimen right after diagnosis and prior to receiving the Standard of Care (SOC), which involves surgery, radiation or concurrent radiochemotherapy. Multikine is designed to help the immune system “see” the tumor at a time when the immune system is still relatively intact and thereby thought to better be able to mount an attack on the tumor. The aim of treatment with Multikine is to boost the body’s immune system prior to SOC to attack the cancer. The Phase 3 study is fully enrolled with 928 patients and the last patient was treated in September 2016. To prove an overall survival benefit, the study requires CEL-SCI to wait until 298 (death) events have occurred among the two main comparator groups. This study milestone occurred in late April 2020. The study is currently in the statistical analysis phase.\r \r The Company’s LEAPS technology is being developed for rheumatoid arthritis and as a potential treatment for COVID-19 infection. The Company has operations in Vienna, Virginia, and near/in Baltimore, Maryland.","categories":["Healthcare","Manufacturing","Technology"],"logoIdentifier":"7e9b0264-1169-4f0e-a32a-7a27ade7b10b","logos":{"wide":"/api/v1/public/instrument-logo/5c8cfe2a-b0fc-46f9-8f43-030f9a27bef4/logo/7e9b0264-1169-4f0e-a32a-7a27ade7b10b/1024/0","thumb":"/api/v1/public/instrument-logo/5c8cfe2a-b0fc-46f9-8f43-030f9a27bef4/logo/7e9b0264-1169-4f0e-a32a-7a27ade7b10b/342/0","micro":"/api/v1/public/instrument-logo/5c8cfe2a-b0fc-46f9-8f43-030f9a27bef4/logo/7e9b0264-1169-4f0e-a32a-7a27ade7b10b/171/0"},"riskRating":7,"comparisonPrices":{"1d":{"value":"0.08","percent":"0.003826","max":"0","min":"0"},"1w":{"value":"-0.09","percent":"-0.004269","max":"22.21","min":"20.91"},"1m":{"value":"-1.34","percent":"-0.060009","max":"24.72","min":"18.89"},"3m":{"value":"1.05","percent":"0.052658","max":"27.49","min":"15.14"},"6m":{"value":"7.5","percent":"0.555967","max":"27.64","min":"11.66"},"1y":{"value":"7.02","percent":"0.502505","max":"27.64","min":"11.05"},"5y":{"value":"9.3","percent":"0.795552","max":"27.64","min":"0.8297"}},"marketPrice":"20.99","marketLastCheck":"2021-06-15T19:59:59Z","tradingStatus":"active","exchangeCountry":"usa","peRatio":"-23.03","marketCap":860008749,"websiteUrl":"www.cel-sci.com","exchange":"NYSE","legacyImageUrl":null,"dominantColour":"#578792","pdsDriveId":null,"assetManager":null,"fixedFeeSpread":null,"managementFeePercent":null,"grossDividendYieldPercent":"0.0","annualisedReturnPercent":"0.502505","ceo":"Geert Kersten","employees":0},{"id":"3832262e-f996-427e-b3ec-bbc9fcd672d8","urlSlug":"peb","instrumentType":"equity","symbol":"PEB","kidsRecommended":false,"isVolatile":false,"name":"Pacific Edge","description":"Pacific Edge Limited is a cancer diagnostics company.
