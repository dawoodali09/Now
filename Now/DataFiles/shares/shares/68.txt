The controller in the K-TIG System uses onboard processors to manipulate current, voltage, travel speed, welding gas, purge gas and water cooling.","categories":["Manufacturing"],"logoIdentifier":"9a1f6c1f-1eaa-44a5-a26b-b6b4d4bb8e28","logos":{"wide":"/api/v1/public/instrument-logo/9a64a23a-ff0c-4db6-b5f9-bcbfbb14bb16/logo/9a1f6c1f-1eaa-44a5-a26b-b6b4d4bb8e28/1024/0","thumb":"/api/v1/public/instrument-logo/9a64a23a-ff0c-4db6-b5f9-bcbfbb14bb16/logo/9a1f6c1f-1eaa-44a5-a26b-b6b4d4bb8e28/342/0","micro":"/api/v1/public/instrument-logo/9a64a23a-ff0c-4db6-b5f9-bcbfbb14bb16/logo/9a1f6c1f-1eaa-44a5-a26b-b6b4d4bb8e28/171/0"},"riskRating":7,"comparisonPrices":{"1d":{"value":"0.005","percent":"0.011111","max":"0","min":"0"},"1w":{"value":"0.005","percent":"0.011111","max":"0.45","min":"0.445"},"1m":{"value":"0.065","percent":"0.166667","max":"0.51","min":"0.335"},"3m":{"value":"-0.045","percent":"-0.09","max":"0.52","min":"0.335"},"6m":{"value":"0.175","percent":"0.625","max":"0.57","min":"0.265"},"1y":{"value":"0.3","percent":"1.935484","max":"0.57","min":"0.155"},"5y":{"value":"0.3869077615","percent":"5.682113","max":"0.655","min":"0.0019851"}},"marketPrice":"0.455","marketLastCheck":"2021-06-16T04:03:19Z","tradingStatus":"active","exchangeCountry":"aus","peRatio":"0.0","marketCap":58197000,"websiteUrl":"http://www.k-tig.com/","exchange":"ASX","legacyImageUrl":null,"dominantColour":"#6896A9","pdsDriveId":null,"assetManager":null,"fixedFeeSpread":null,"managementFeePercent":null,"grossDividendYieldPercent":"0.0","annualisedReturnPercent":"1.935484","ceo":null,"employees":0},{"id":"bc6798ed-52e8-4f82-892b-16c2c1d4b278","urlSlug":"asx-chm","instrumentType":"equity","symbol":"CHM","kidsRecommended":false,"isVolatile":false,"name":"Chimeric Therapeutics Ltd","description":"Chimeric Therapeutics Limited is an Australia-based company engaged in developing CAR T cell therapies for solid tumors.
