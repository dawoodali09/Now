The Company enables executives to communicate company-wide goals, monitor status, and oversee work across projects to gain real-time insights into which initiatives are on track or at risk. Asana is powered by its multi-dimensional data model called the work graph. The work graph captures and associates units of work, the people responsible for executing those units of work, the processes in which work gets done, information about that work, and the relationships across and within the data.","categories":["Services","Technology"],"logoIdentifier":"66b6415d-de10-4c45-a095-08ce5f55e479","logos":{"wide":"/api/v1/public/instrument-logo/c019922a-65c5-48da-8b3b-0517ee21323c/logo/66b6415d-de10-4c45-a095-08ce5f55e479/1024/0","thumb":"/api/v1/public/instrument-logo/c019922a-65c5-48da-8b3b-0517ee21323c/logo/66b6415d-de10-4c45-a095-08ce5f55e479/342/0","micro":"/api/v1/public/instrument-logo/c019922a-65c5-48da-8b3b-0517ee21323c/logo/66b6415d-de10-4c45-a095-08ce5f55e479/171/0"},"riskRating":7,"comparisonPrices":{"1d":{"value":"0.0","percent":"0.0","max":"0","min":"0"},"1w":{"value":"5.67","percent":"0.137789","max":"46.82","min":"41.15"},"1m":{"value":"17.41","percent":"0.591976","max":"46.82","min":"30.46"},"3m":{"value":"13.48","percent":"0.404319","max":"46.82","min":"26.16"},"6m":{"value":"17.7","percent":"0.60783","max":"46.82","min":"26.16"},"1y":null,"5y":null},"marketPrice":"46.82","marketLastCheck":"2021-06-15T19:59:59Z","tradingStatus":"active","exchangeCountry":"usa","peRatio":"-23.53","marketCap":4300240535,"websiteUrl":"asana.com","exchange":"NYSE","legacyImageUrl":null,"dominantColour":"#F3B6B1","pdsDriveId":null,"assetManager":null,"fixedFeeSpread":null,"managementFeePercent":null,"grossDividendYieldPercent":"0.0","annualisedReturnPercent":null,"ceo":"","employees":900},{"id":"af986bf9-3548-4a95-933b-853c8c889ecf","urlSlug":"nyse-cbu","instrumentType":"equity","symbol":"CBU","kidsRecommended":false,"isVolatile":false,"name":"Community Bank System, Inc.","description":"Community Bank System, Inc. is a bank holding company.
