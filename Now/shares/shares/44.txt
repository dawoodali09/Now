Magellan perceives outstanding companies to be those that are able to sustainably exploit competitive advantages in order to continually earn returns on capital that are materially in excess of their cost of capital. While Magellan is extremely focused on fundamental business value, it is not a typical 'value' investor. The Magellan High Conviction Trust will invest in companies that have relatively high price-to-earnings and price-to-book multiples, provided that their businesses are outstanding and their shares are trading at an appropriate discount to their assessed intrinsic value. Equities that appear undervalued on the basis of a low price-to-earnings or price-to-book multiples will often prove to be poor investments if the underlying business is fundamentally weak and exhibits poor returns on capital. Magellan focuses on risk-adjusted returns, rather than benchmark-relative returns. As a result, the Magellan High Conviction Trust investment process is designed to generate an unconstrained, highly-concentrated portfolio of high-quality companies. The Magellan High Conviction Trust will comprise of 8 to 12 investments, with the portfolio weighted towards Magellan's highest-conviction ideas.","categories":["Strategic funds"],"logoIdentifier":"8a408baa-98c7-4ad1-b5a5-940f9070422e","logos":{"wide":"/api/v1/public/instrument-logo/17214b29-e018-4d2f-9919-f8bb73890a51/logo/8a408baa-98c7-4ad1-b5a5-940f9070422e/1024/0","thumb":"/api/v1/public/instrument-logo/17214b29-e018-4d2f-9919-f8bb73890a51/logo/8a408baa-98c7-4ad1-b5a5-940f9070422e/342/0","micro":"/api/v1/public/instrument-logo/17214b29-e018-4d2f-9919-f8bb73890a51/logo/8a408baa-98c7-4ad1-b5a5-940f9070422e/171/0"},"riskRating":7,"comparisonPrices":{"1d":{"value":"-0.005","percent":"-0.003247","max":"0","min":"0"},"1w":{"value":"0.065","percent":"0.044218","max":"1.54","min":"1.47"},"1m":{"value":"0.105","percent":"0.073427","max":"1.54","min":"1.425"},"3m":{"value":"0.125","percent":"0.088652","max":"1.54","min":"1.37"},"6m":{"value":"0.05","percent":"0.03367","max":"1.54","min":"1.37"},"1y":{"value":"0.155","percent":"0.112319","max":"1.595","min":"1.37"},"5y":null},"marketPrice":"1.535","marketLastCheck":"2021-06-16T04:03:21Z","tradingStatus":"active","exchangeCountry":"aus","peRatio":"0.0","marketCap":909705000,"websiteUrl":"https://www.magellangroup.com.au/magellan-high-conviction-trust/","exchange":"ASX","legacyImageUrl":null,"dominantColour":"#7F95B4","pdsDriveId":null,"assetManager":null,"fixedFeeSpread":null,"managementFeePercent":null,"grossDividendYieldPercent":"0.0","annualisedReturnPercent":"0.112319","ceo":null,"employees":0},{"id":"2c9f0414-fb92-4830-ad02-089fd35287f4","urlSlug":"nyse-cls","instrumentType":"equity","symbol":"CLS","kidsRecommended":false,"isVolatile":false,"name":"Celestica, Inc.","description":"Celestica Inc. is a provider of supply chain solutions.
