The Company’s cell-free protein synthesis platform, comprising the XpressCFTM platform, exclusively licensed from Sutro Biopharma, Inc., together with Vaxcyte’s proprietary know-how, enables the design and production of protein carriers and antigens, the critical building blocks of vaccines, in ways that the Company believes conventional vaccine technologies currently cannot. Vaxcyte’s lead vaccine candidate, VAX-24, is a preclinical, 24-valent broad-spectrum pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) being developed for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Vaxcyte’s pipeline also includes VAX-XP, a PCV with an expanded breadth of coverage of at least 30 strains, including newly emerging strains responsible for IPD and antibiotic resistance; VAX-A1, a prophylactic vaccine candidate designed to prevent Group A Strep infections; and VAX-PG, a therapeutic vaccine candidate designed to slow or stop the progression of periodontal disease by targeting the keystone pathogen responsible for this chronic, oral inflammatory disease.","categories":["Healthcare","Manufacturing","Technology"],"logoIdentifier":"e7532be0-4a57-4d70-b547-fc100ff56ab0","logos":{"wide":"/api/v1/public/instrument-logo/8dbcb1aa-111a-492e-8a88-8878ddafb2b3/logo/e7532be0-4a57-4d70-b547-fc100ff56ab0/1024/0","thumb":"/api/v1/public/instrument-logo/8dbcb1aa-111a-492e-8a88-8878ddafb2b3/logo/e7532be0-4a57-4d70-b547-fc100ff56ab0/342/0","micro":"/api/v1/public/instrument-logo/8dbcb1aa-111a-492e-8a88-8878ddafb2b3/logo/e7532be0-4a57-4d70-b547-fc100ff56ab0/171/0"},"riskRating":7,"comparisonPrices":{"1d":{"value":"0.01","percent":"0.000453","max":"0","min":"0"},"1w":{"value":"-1.31","percent":"-0.055983","max":"23.4","min":"22.01"},"1m":{"value":"2.85","percent":"0.148129","max":"24.06","min":"19.14"},"3m":{"value":"-4.63","percent":"-0.173278","max":"27.25","min":"16.45"},"6m":{"value":"-10.43","percent":"-0.320726","max":"32.52","min":"16.45"},"1y":{"value":"-10.81","percent":"-0.328571","max":"55.4","min":"16.45"},"5y":null},"marketPrice":"22.09","marketLastCheck":"2021-06-15T19:59:52Z","tradingStatus":"active","exchangeCountry":"usa","peRatio":"0","marketCap":1134956146,"websiteUrl":"vaxcyte.com","exchange":"NASDAQ","legacyImageUrl":null,"dominantColour":"#88C19F","pdsDriveId":null,"assetManager":null,"fixedFeeSpread":null,"managementFeePercent":null,"grossDividendYieldPercent":"0.0","annualisedReturnPercent":"-0.328571","ceo":"Grant Pickering","employees":14000},{"id":"61f810fd-ea12-4f12-a6c3-4a9d9b2c8aa6","urlSlug":"nasdaq-trhc","instrumentType":"equity","symbol":"TRHC","kidsRecommended":false,"isVolatile":false,"name":"Tabula Rasa HealthCare Inc","description":"Tabula Rasa HealthCare, Inc.
