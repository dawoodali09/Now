Anavex's lead drug candidate, ANAVEX®2-73 (blarcamesine), recently completed a successful Phase 2a clinical trial for Alzheimer's disease. ANAVEX®2-73 (blarcamesine) is an orally available drug candidate that restores cellular homeostasis by targeting sigma-1 and muscarinic receptors. Preclinical studies demonstrated its potential to halt and/or reverse the course of Alzheimer's disease. ANAVEX®2-73 (blarcamesine) also exhibited anticonvulsant, anti-amnesic, neuroprotective and anti-depressant properties in animal models, indicating its potential to treat additional CNS disorders, including epilepsy. The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research previously awarded Anavex a research grant, which fully funded a preclinical study to develop ANAVEX®2-73 (blarcamesine) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. ANAVEX®3-71, which targets sigma-1 and muscarinic receptors, is a promising preclinical drug candidate demonstrating disease-modifying activity against the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease in transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice, including cognitive deficits, amyloid and tau pathologies. In preclinical trials, ANAVEX®3-71 has shown beneficial effects on mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation.","categories":["Healthcare","Manufacturing","Technology"],"logoIdentifier":"3d551b66-d2f3-4bd4-b521-2ca031b266c1","logos":{"wide":"/api/v1/public/instrument-logo/eba3f3e1-9ee8-42be-b3ac-4f6784237cda/logo/3d551b66-d2f3-4bd4-b521-2ca031b266c1/1024/0","thumb":"/api/v1/public/instrument-logo/eba3f3e1-9ee8-42be-b3ac-4f6784237cda/logo/3d551b66-d2f3-4bd4-b521-2ca031b266c1/342/0","micro":"/api/v1/public/instrument-logo/eba3f3e1-9ee8-42be-b3ac-4f6784237cda/logo/3d551b66-d2f3-4bd4-b521-2ca031b266c1/171/0"},"riskRating":7,"comparisonPrices":{"1d":{"value":"0.0","percent":"0.0","max":"0","min":"0"},"1w":{"value":"2.09","percent":"0.137049","max":"20.99","min":"15.25"},"1m":{"value":"6.26","percent":"0.564982","max":"20.99","min":"11.1"},"3m":{"value":"1.21","percent":"0.075015","max":"20.99","min":"10.16"},"6m":{"value":"11.54","percent":"1.989655","max":"20.99","min":"5.17"},"1y":{"value":"13.19","percent":"3.178313","max":"20.99","min":"3.8"},"5y":{"value":"13.05","percent":"3.041958","max":"20.99","min":"1.25"}},"marketPrice":"17.34","marketLastCheck":"2021-06-15T19:59:57Z","tradingStatus":"active","exchangeCountry":"usa","peRatio":"0","marketCap":1214474873,"websiteUrl":"anavex.com","exchange":"NASDAQ","legacyImageUrl":null,"dominantColour":"#ACA79C","pdsDriveId":null,"assetManager":null,"fixedFeeSpread":null,"managementFeePercent":null,"grossDividendYieldPercent":"0.0","annualisedReturnPercent":"3.178313","ceo":"Christopher Missling","employees":0},{"id":"b7c4136e-fb27-423c-98fc-bae90dd44210","urlSlug":"nasdaq-amsf","instrumentType":"equity","symbol":"AMSF","kidsRecommended":false,"isVolatile":false,"name":"Amerisafe Inc","description":"Amerisafe, Inc. is an insurance holding company.
